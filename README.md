# Layered-Terraform-Practice-Example
Setting up a layered multi cloud multi environment terraform

Will try to setup a large corp mixed environment

This is for learning to see what I can do in a larger environment with multiple hybrid apps. 

please don't take any of this seriously. This is for me to update and upgrade my terraform skills. 

It will build up slowly as I get time to do it. Constructive criticism is always appreciated, reddit style isn't

This is particularly for me to practice a multi cloud, hybrid, multi virtualised environment. 

do NOT use this yourself in anything that can be called production or dev or even test! This is my playground & if you ACTUALLY plug it into your own environments, thats 100% on you

And yes I know it's probably better to have seperate repositories for each cloud environment and hybrids - but this is a learning experience for me..

zero trust and blast radius are my next tattoos!
